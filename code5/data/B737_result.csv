28-21 TASK 816,Refuel Quantity Indicator Flashes - Fault Isolation,"A. Description
(1) One of the refuel quantity indicators flashes at an interval of approximately one second and
shows the fuel quantity in the applicable tank.
(2) The flashing shows that the fuel quantity (as calculated by the fuel quantity processor) is more
than the expected full tank shutoff quantity (total tank volume minus 2 percent expansion
volume). The fueling float switch is designed to close the applicable fueling shutoff valve during
pressure fueling when the applicable tank has an expansion volume of 2 percent. The fuel
quantity processor causes the applicable refuel quantity indicator to flash when it calculates a
fuel quantity of more than the full tank shutoff quantity. The design tolerance of the Fuel
Quantity Indicating System (FQIS) is +/- 2 percent. Thus, because of variations in fuel density
and in the rate of closure of the fueling shutoff valve, it is possible for a tank to contain more (or
in a few cases less) than the expected full tank shutoff quantity and cause the fuel quantity
display on the refuel panel to flash.
(3) AIRPLANES WITH FUEL QUANTITY PROCESSOR S345A001-010; This condition can occur
because it is possible for processor S345A001-010 to read a fuel quantity that is more than the
overfill quantity when the actual fuel quantity is less than the overfill quantity. If it is possible,
replace processor S345A001-010 with S345A001-011 (for standard 737-600, -700, and -800)
or S345A001-015 (for 737-700 Increased Gross Weight or the Boeing Business Jet) before

29-10TASK 803,Electrical Power to the System A EMDP Problem - Fault Isolation,"A. Description
(1) When the system A ELEC 2 switch is ON, 28v DC energizes the system A EMDP relay which
closes three contacts. These contacts send 115v AC power to the system A EMDP. When the
system A EMDP switch is in the OFF position, the system A EMDP relay has no power and the
contacts open to stop the EMDP.

211-221, 250-299, 301-399, 401-999
(2) The system A EMDP relay is connected to ground through an internal jumper in the EMDP.
This enables control of the EMDP from the hydraulic control panel. An open circuit in this path
will disable the relay and prevent electrical power from reaching the EMDP. The ELEC 2 LOW
PRESSURE light will come on if the system A EMDP is unable to operate.
CEA 071, 072, 166-169
(3) The system A EMDP relay is connected to ground through an internal temperature switch in
the EMDP. When the temperature of the EMDP is normal, the temperature switch is closed.
This enables control of the EMDP from the hydraulic control panel. When the EMDP
temperature is more than 255 degrees F (124 degrees C), the temperature switch opens and
removes the ground from the EMDP relay. This stops the EMDP and causes the ELEC 2 LOW
PRESSURE light to come on.

29-10TASK 804,Electrical Power to the System B EMDP Problem - Fault Isolation,"A. Description
(1) When the system B ELEC 1 switch is ON, 28v DC energizes the system B EMDP relay which
closes three contacts. These contacts send 115v AC power to the system B EMDP. When the
system B EMDP switch is in the OFF position, the system B EMDP relay has no power and the
contacts open to stop the EMDP.
CEA 001-045, 051-054, 060, 073-078, 101-112, 114, 115, 117-148, 151-160, 171-188, 191-194, 206-208,
211-221, 250-299, 301-399, 401-999
(2) The system B EMDP relay is connected to ground through an internal jumper in the EMDP.
This enables control of the EMDP from the hydraulic control panel. An open circuit in this path
will disable the relay and prevent electrical power from reaching the EMDP. The ELEC 1 LOW
PRESSURE light will come on if the system B EMDP is unable to operate.
CEA 071, 072, 166-169
(3) The system B EMDP relay is connected to ground through an internal temperature switch in
the EMDP. When the temperature of the EMDP is normal, the temperature switch is closed.
This enables control of the EMDP from the hydraulic control panel. When the EMDP
temperature is more than 255 degrees F (124 degrees C), the temperature switch opens and
removes the ground from the EMDP relay. This stops the EMDP and causes the ELEC 1 LOW
PRESSURE light to come on.

29-10TASK 807,Hydraulic Fluid Transfers from System B to System A - Fault Isolation,"A. Description
(1) Hydraulic system design allows fluid transfer to occur from system B to system A under these
abnormal or infrequent operating conditions:
(a) When parking brakes are set with system B pump(s) pressurized and then released with
system B depressurized and system A pump(s) pressurized. In this case, fluid is taken
from system B when the brakes are set and returned to system A when the brakes are
released. Approximately 5 fluid ounces can be transferred per cycle.
1) To prevent hydraulic fluid transfer under these conditions, follow the normal
procedures in the pre-flight and post-flight Flight Operations Manual.
(b) When the left thrust reverser is operated by the standby hydraulic system. During thrust
reverser deployment, fluid is taken from the standby system reservoir (and the B system
reservoir through the fluid balance line), to fill the left thrust reverser actuators, and then
is returned to the A system reservoir during reverser stowing. Approximately 0.50 gallons
of fluid can be transferred per thrust reverser cycle.
1) This transfer occurs infrequently and only during abnormal conditions.
(c) When landing gears are cycled, the airplane is in AIR mode and N2 on engine 1 is less
than 55%. In this condition, the landing gear transfer valve shuttles during gear retraction
when the system B fluid is used to fill the actuators. After gear retraction, the landing gear
transfer valve shuttles back to its normal position, so that subsequent extension of the
landing gear returns the fluid to system A. Approximately 0.50 gallon of fluid will be
transferred per cycle. Landing gear transfer valve operation is controlled through the
Proximity Sensor Electronic Unit (PSEU).
1) Fluid transfer will occur under specific flight conditions and during cycling of the
landing gear during maintenance (airplane on jacks). To prevent this, you must open
the landing gear transfer valve primary and secondary circuit breakers before you
cycle the landing gear.

29-10TASK 813,System A or System B Hydraulic Pressure Momentarily Below 2800 psi Problem - Fault Isolation,"A. Description
(1) When selecting landing gear or high lift devices, hydraulic system pressures may drop for up to
10 seconds during normal operation. Momentary hydraulic pressure drops lasting from 10 to
40 seconds may be indications of a fault.
(2) The low pressure light illuminates when the pressure drops below 1200 psi.
(3) Hydraulic system pressure drop during high flow demand is usually caused by cavitation of the
engine driven pump (EDP). Cavitation may be caused by a restriction in the EDP supply line or
by reservoir pressurization system problems.
(4) The landing gear runs off of System A pressure, and the wing high lift devices run off of System
B pressure. Each system is tested separately in this procedure.
(5) A hydraulic pump can be damaged if it operates during a momentary loss of pressure. If
pressure is lost for an extended time, then check the applicable pressure and case drain filters.
A contaminated filter can be an indication of a damaged pump.
B. Possible Causes
(1) If there is a momentary loss of, or no recovery of hydraulic pressure after ending high demand
activities, the following are possible causes, in order of probability:
(a) Symptoms that occur during descent, but which can not be duplicated on the ground,
may be caused by water trapped in the reservoir pressurization system freezing during
cruise. These symptoms are considered intermittent faults.
(b) Reservoir pressurization system faults:

29-10TASK 813,System A or System B Hydraulic Pressure Momentarily Below 2801 psi Problem - Fault Isolation,"A. Description
(1) When selecting landing gear or high lift devices, hydraulic system pressures may drop for up to
10 seconds during normal operation. Momentary hydraulic pressure drops lasting from 10 to
40 seconds may be indications of a fault.
(2) The low pressure light illuminates when the pressure drops below 1200 psi.
(3) Hydraulic system pressure drop during high flow demand is usually caused by cavitation of the
engine driven pump (EDP). Cavitation may be caused by a restriction in the EDP supply line or
by reservoir pressurization system problems.
(4) The landing gear runs off of System A pressure, and the wing high lift devices run off of System
B pressure. Each system is tested separately in this procedure.
(5) A hydraulic pump can be damaged if it operates during a momentary loss of pressure. If
pressure is lost for an extended time, then check the applicable pressure and case drain filters.
A contaminated filter can be an indication of a damaged pump.
B. Possible Causes
(1) If there is a momentary loss of, or no recovery of hydraulic pressure after ending high demand
activities, the following are possible causes, in order of probability:
(a) Symptoms that occur during descent, but which can not be duplicated on the ground,
may be caused by water trapped in the reservoir pressurization system freezing during
cruise. These symptoms are considered intermittent faults.

G. Confirmation of Fault Correction
(1) Repeat the Initial Evaluation tests above.
(a) If the hydraulic pressure in each system momentarily drops and then recovers, or does
not drop at all, you have corrected the fault"
29-10TASK 813,System A or System B Hydraulic Pressure Momentarily Below 2802 psi Problem - Fault Isolation,"A. Description
(1) When selecting landing gear or high lift devices, hydraulic system pressures may drop for up to
10 seconds during normal operation. Momentary hydraulic pressure drops lasting from 10 to
40 seconds may be indications of a fault.
(2) The low pressure light illuminates when the pressure drops below 1200 psi.
(3) Hydraulic system pressure drop during high flow demand is usually caused by cavitation of the
engine driven pump (EDP). Cavitation may be caused by a restriction in the EDP supply line or
by reservoir pressurization system problems.
(4) The landing gear runs off of System A pressure, and the wing high lift devices run off of System
B pressure. Each system is tested separately in this procedure.
(5) A hydraulic pump can be damaged if it operates during a momentary loss of pressure. If
pressure is lost for an extended time, then check the applicable pressure and case drain filters.
A contaminated filter can be an indication of a damaged pump.
B. Possible Causes
(1) If there is a momentary loss of, or no recovery of hydraulic pressure after ending high demand
activities, the following are possible causes, in order of probability:
(a) Symptoms that occur during descent, but which can not be duplicated on the ground,
may be caused by water trapped in the reservoir pressurization system freezing during
cruise. These symptoms are considered intermittent faults.
(b) Reservoir pressurization system faults:

(e) If the system B hydraulic pressure indication on the center instrument panel, P2, is
between 2800 and 3200 psi, then continue with Test System B Hydraulic Pressure
Recovery.
NOTE: There is no test of the system A hydraulic pressure recovery. The test requires
operating high-flow systems while running the EDP. Proper testing of system A
would retract the landing gear, which would require that the airplane be on jacks.
This is not practical while running the EDP. If momentary hydraulic pressure
drops have only been noted in system A, go to the Fault Isolation below.

29-11TASK 801,"Engine Driven Pump Operates (engine windmills) with the Supply Shutoff Valve Closed (fire
handle pulled) - Fault Isolation","A. Description
(1) The engine fire switches isolate the engine if there is an engine fire. Each engine fire switch
controls the supply shutoff valve for its related Engine Driven Pump (EDP).
(2) When you pull the engine fire switch, the Engine Driven Pump (EDP) supply shutoff valve
moves to the closed position. This stops the supply of hydraulic fluid to the EDP.
B. Possible Causes
(1) Because the supply of hydraulic fluid to EDP stops when you move the engine fire switch up,
case drain flow does not flow through the EDP. If the engine continues to turn (windmill) with
the supply shutoff valve in the closed position, the EDP may be damaged.
C. Initial Evaluation
(1) If you move either engine No. 1 or 2 fire switches to the up position with the corresponding
engine driven pump (EDP) operating, then do this check:
(a) If the supply shutoff valve was closed for less than five minutes, no maintenance action is
required and shutoff periods are not accumulative.
(b) If the supply shutoff valve was closed for more than five minutes, make sure that the EDP
has operated for at least one minute with supply fluid available before you check the filter
elements. This is to permit fluid to reach the filter that may have metal contamination,
possibly generated during fluid shutoff, then do the Fault Isolation Procedure below:

32-32 TASK 804,Right (Left) Main Landing Gear Slow to Retract or Extend - Fault Isolation,"A. Description
(1) The extension and retraction sequence is the same for the left and right main landing gear. The
main landing gear extension and retraction system has these hydraulic components:
(a) Main gear actuator
(b) Downlock actuator
(c) Uplock actuator
(d) Transfer cylinder
(e) Landing gear selector valve
(2) The sequence for main gear retraction is as follows:
(a) The landing gear selector valve supplies up pressure when the control lever for the
landing gear is moved to the UP position.
(b) Up pressure goes to the transfer cylinder and moves the piston in the transfer cylinder to
the down side. This gives a time delay to let the downlock actuator unlock the downlock
strut.
(c) Up pressure goes to the downlock actuator. The downlock actuator extends and unlocks
the downlock strut.
(d) When the piston in the transfer cylinder gets to the end of the up side, up pressure goes
to the up side of the main gear actuator. The main gear actuator moves to retract the
gear.(e) When the uplock roller on the main gear moves into the hook of the uplock mechanism,
the uplock mechanism moves to the locked position.
(3) The sequence for main gear extension is as follows:
(a) The landing gear selector valve supplies down pressure when the control lever for the
landing gear is moved to the DN position.
(b) Down pressure goes to the transfer cylinder and moves the piston in the transfer cylinder
to the up side. This momentarily applies a retract force to the main gear to decrease the
forces in the uplock mechanism so the uplock actuator can operate it.
(c) Down pressure goes to the uplock actuator. The uplock actuator retracts and unlocks the
uplock mechanism.
(d) When the piston in the transfer cylinder gets to the end of the up side, down pressure
goes to the down side of the main gear actuator. The main gear actuator moves to extend
the gear.
(e) Down pressure goes to retract the downlock actuator. The downlock actuator moves the
downlock strut to the locked position as the main landing gear extends.
